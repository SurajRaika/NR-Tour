## Tour Overview

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
Pushkar Fair, held in the sacred town of Pushkar, Rajasthan, is the largest camel and cattle fair in India. With over 50,000 camels gathered in one place, the fair is a spectacle of trade, culture, and tradition. Beyond cattle trading, it is a religious pilgrimage and a marketplace for exquisite Rajasthani and Gujarati handicrafts.
</p>

## Origin & History

<p class="text-lg">
According to Hindu mythology, Lord Brahma conducted a grand yagna at the spot where a divine swan dropped a flower. This sacred land became known as Pushkar. While the fair started as a cattle trade event, it has evolved into a religious and cultural celebration, with devotees taking a holy dip in Pushkar Lake and visiting its temples.
