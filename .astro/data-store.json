While Tailwind provides an extensive set of built-in styles, it’s also easy to customize your project with your own fonts and styles. In this blog post, we’ll go through the steps to apply custom fonts and styles on a Tailwind CSS project using the tailwind.config.js file.\n\n## Choose Your Fonts\n\nThe first step to applying custom fonts on a Tailwind CSS project is to choose the fonts you want to use. There are many websites where you can download free fonts or use a CDN such as: You can also use paid fonts from websites like:\n\n- [Font Share](https://www.fontshare.com/)\n- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)\n- [Colletivo](https://www.collletttivo.it/)\n- [Type Cooper](http://coopertype.org/)\n- [The league of movable type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/)\n- [Velvetyne](https://velvetyne.fr/)\n  or paid fonts from:\n- [Linotype](https://www.linotype.com)\n- [Atypo](https://www.atipofoundry.com/)\n- [Pangram Pangram](https://pangrampangram.com/)\n- [Typeheist](https://typeheist.co/) Once you have chosen your fonts, you need to add them to your project. You can do this by downloading the font files and placing them in a folder within your project’s directory.\n\n## Define Custom Font Family\n\nAfter downloading the font files or using the CDN, you need to define a custom font family in the tailwind.config.js file. Open the file and add the following code to the theme section.first-letter: Here is an example of Lexington Themes talwind.config.js file\n```js\n/\\*_ @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} _/\nconst defaultTheme = require(\"tailwindcss/defaultTheme\");\nmodule.exports = {\n    theme: {\n        fontFamily: {\n            sans: [\"Inter var\", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],\n            mono: [\"JetBrains Mono\", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.mono],\n        },\n    },\n};\nIn this code, “Inter\nvar” and“ JetBrains Mono” is the name of the font family you want to use, “Inter\nvar” and“ JetBrains Mono” is the name of the font you downloaded or used the CDN, and `defaultTheme.fontFamily`\nis the fallback font in\n    case the custom font doesn’ t load.\n\n# # Define Custom Styles\n\nOnce you have defined the custom font family, you can define custom styles that use it.You can create a class\nfor each style or add them to existing Tailwind CSS classes.For example, you can add custom styles to the h1 class as follows:\n    module.exports = {\n        theme: {\n            fontSize: {\n                xs: [\n                    \"0.75rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"1rem\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                sm: [\n                    \"0.875rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"1.5rem\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                base: [\n                    \"1rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"1.75rem\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                lg: [\n                    \"1.125rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"2rem\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                xl: [\n                    \"1.25rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"2rem\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                \"2xl\": [\n                    \"1.5rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"2rem\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                \"3xl\": [\n                    \"2rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"2.5rem\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                \"4xl\": [\n                    \"2.5rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"3.5rem\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                \"5xl\": [\n                    \"3rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"3.5rem\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                \"6xl\": [\n                    \"3.75rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"1\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                \"7xl\": [\n                    \"4.5rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"1.1\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                \"8xl\": [\n                    \"6rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"1\",\n                    },\n                ],\n                \"9xl\": [\n                    \"8rem\",\n                    {\n                        lineHeight: \"1\",\n                    },\n                ],\n            },\n            extend: {\n                fontFamily: {\n                    sans: [\"Inter var\", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],\n                    mono: [\"JetBrains Mono\", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.mono],\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    };\n```\nIn this code, we added custom styles to outsite the theme section to be able ot override Tailwind’s classes. We added a custom font weight and line-height.\n\n## Apply Custom Styles\n\nTo apply your custom styles to your HTML, use the class attribute and the classes you created or extended in the tailwind.config.js file. For example, to apply the custom styles to an h1 element, add the class attribute as follows:\n```html\n\u003Ch1 class=\"font-sans\">Hello World\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp class=\"font-mono\">Hello World, again\u003C/p>\n```\nIn this code, you do not need to add the `font-sans` class because is the default class that Tailwind css uses, but you will have to use `font-mono` to define the mono font within your HTMl. But no inside `\u003Cpre>` or `\u003Ccode>` because the font is already mono\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, customizing fonts and styles in a Tailwind CSS project using the tailwind.config.js file is straightforward. You can choose your fonts, define a custom font family, define custom styles, and apply them to your HTML elements using the classes you created or extended. With these steps, you can create unique and personalized designs that stand out from the rest.","src/content/posts/4.md","7db0f7d63f362a54",{"html":274,"metadata":275},"\u003Ch1 id=\"defining-typography-on-your-tailwind-css-project\">Defining typography on your Tailwind CSS project\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>This blog post shows how to add custom typography to your Tailwind CSS project, with example code.\u003C/em>\nTailwind CSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework that offers a wide range of pre-defined classes to make web development faster and more efficient.

After a while, if you have a poorly crafted theme, so your eyes are going to hurt.\r\nTaking into account that you spend a lot of hours working on VS Code, you may want to created or adapt it to your taste and personality. Believe it or not, this will make you more productive and feel comfortable when working.\r\n\r\n## Let's get our hands dirty.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you can customize the theme you are actually using by opening the **User settings** on VS Code your **command palette**\r\nOnce you are there you can edit the .json by starting with this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\r\n    ---- Styles go here ----\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see all the scopes here:\r\n\r\n- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color\r\n  But, this is a nightmare to be honest, as you can see there's a lot of scopes and it will take you ages to do it.\r\n\r\n## Let's create our own theme from scratch\r\n\r\nWe are going to need:\r\n\r\n- A laptop\r\n- VS Code installed\r\n- Microsoft Azure Account\r\n- Microsoft Marketplace Account\r\n- GitHub Account\r\n- Patience\r\n  We are going to use:\r\n- VS Code\r\n- Terminal\r\n- VS Code Debugger\r\n- A random but useful color tool\r\n  For color palettes you use my tool [Colors & Fonts](https://www.colorsandfonts.com/)\r\n  or for something more advance, use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)\r\n\r\n## First and foremost\r\n\r\nLet's grab the command line tool called [Yo Code extension generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code), which it will create all the files you need to build your theme.\r\nOnly build, not publish but more on this later on.\r\n\r\n1. Open up your terminal window and navigate to your main GitHub folder.\r\n2. Then run on the terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g yo generator-code\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the it finishes to install run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyo code\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will get all this options.\r\n**Select:**\r\n\r\n1. **New Color Theme**\r\n   What type of extension do you want to create? (Use arrow keys)\r\n   New Extension (TypeScript)\r\n   New Extension (JavaScript)\r\n   **❯ New Color Theme**\r\n   New Language Support\r\n   New Code Snippets\r\n   New Keymap\r\n   New Extension Pack\r\n   New Language Pack (Localization)\r\n   New Web Extension (TypeScript)\r\n   New Notebook Renderer\r\n   **Select**: 2. **No, start fresh**\r\n   Do you want to import or convert an existing TextMate color theme? (Use arrow keys)\r\n   **No, start fresh **\r\n   Yes, import an existing theme but keep it as tmTheme file.\r\n   Yes, import an existing theme and inline it in the Visual Studio Code color theme file.\r\n   Then you will be asked this questions.If you are going to create this theme to be publish and grow it into a UI Theme a part of for VS Code, you may want to think about how you name it.\r\n\r\n## Important step\r\n\r\n> Let's say you name it \"A\" this name you can change it afterwards, as the rest of answers you give but, if you change the identifier and you publish again, this will create a different theme on VS Code Marketplace\r\n> 3.Answer\r\n> What's the name of your extension? Your Theme's name\r\n> **_? What's the identifier of your extension? Your Theme's identifier_**\r\n> ? What's the description of your extension? Your Theme's Description\r\n> ? What's the name of your theme shown to the user? Your Theme's name\r\n> Then we are going to need a starting point and Yo Code gives you the choices so choose the one you want to.\r\n> Select a base theme: (Use arrow keys)\r\n> ❯ Dark\r\n> Light\r\n> High Contrast 4. Answer\r\n> **Initialize a git repository? (Y/n)**\r\n> I say always no because is not always working...so I simply push afterwards. 5. Open do it as you wish.\r\n> Do you want to open the new folder with Visual Studio Code? (Use arrow keys)\r\n> ❯ Open with `code`\r\n> Skip\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n\r\nThis are the files generated by Yo Code\r\n![files](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u8h9v2s54lgcz16g33cu.png)\r\nLet's go through some of the files.\r\n**1. .vscode/launch.json**\r\nYou won't use the file but is good to know what it is for.\r\n\r\n> The launch.json file is used to configure the debugger in Visual Studio Code.\r\n> **2. themes/your-theme.json**\r\n> This is the file you are going to be working on to create your theme. Right now it includes the styles for VS Code default theme.\r\n> **3. .vscodeignore**\r\n> Basically like .gitignore\r\n> A VSCODEIGNORE file is a text file used to exclude unnecessary files when packaging a Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension.\r\n> **4. Changelog.md**\r\n> You can write this changelog and if you publish it marketplace will link to it directly.\r\n> **5. package.json**\r\n> On this file is where we are going to pack, add and write some code to be able to publish it on the marketplace.\r\n> **6. readme.md**\r\n> This is well, the read me.
